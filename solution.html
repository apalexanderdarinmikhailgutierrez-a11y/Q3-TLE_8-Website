                <h1>Behind The Campaign</h1>
                <p>
                    The solution directly addresses this by organizing a formal meeting or information campaign to
                    educate both students and teachers about the real-life importance and academic value of TLE. By
                    explaining how TLE helps develop practical life skills, improves grades, and prepares students for
                    future careers and adulthood, we can change their mindset and increase interest in the subject.

                     <h3>How it's Done</h3>
                     <p>
                         Organizing a meeting or campaign can be done within school hours using available classrooms,
                         audiovisual equipment, and teacher support. Posters, short presentations, and simple
                         demonstrations can be prepared by students and teachers without needing a large budget. Asking
                         for additional funding from the government or school administration can be done gradually while
                         awareness activities start immediately.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Who are involved?</h3>
                     <p>
                         The project will be carried out by both students and professors. Students will assist in
                         creating posters, presentations, and brief discussions regarding the significance of TLE.
                         Teachers will moderate the conversation, authorise materials, and help plan the meeting or
                         campaign.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Preparation Time</h3>
                     <p>
                         The preparation may take about 1–2 weeks, including planning, creating materials, and
                         coordinating with teachers. The actual meeting or campaign can be completed in one school day
                         or several class periods. Monitoring results may take one month or more to observe changes in
                         participation and performance.

            <h1>Challenges</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited budget for materials</li>
                <li>Lack of interest or participation from some students</li>
                <li>Scheduling conflicts with other school activities</li>
                <li>Delays in receiving additional funding</li>
                <li>Limited time for preparation</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="end">
                These can be addressed by using low-cost materials, encouraging teamwork, and coordinating early with
                teachers and administrators.
